== Introduction

Java Web Start (JWS) was deprecated in Java 9, and starting with Java 11, Oracle removed JWS from their JDK distributions. This means that clients that have the latest version of Java installed can no longer use JWS-based applications. And since public support of Java 8 has ended in Q2/2019, companies no longer get any updates and security fixes for Java Web Start.

This is why some enthusiasts at Karakun decided to create OpenWebStart, an open source reimplementation of the Java Web Start technology. This guide describes how you can use OpenWebStart as a replacement for JWS and continue using your JNLP-based applications  with little or no change at all.

We appreciate your feedback. If you feel that there's a lack of documentation in a certain area or if you find inaccuracies in the documentation, please don't hesitate to contact us at openwebstart@karakun.com or the  https://board.karakun.com/viewforum.php?f=4[support forum].

=== What is OpenWebStart?

OpenWebStart is an open source reimplementation of the Java Web Start technology, released under the GPL with Classpath Exception. It provides the most commonly used features of Java Web Start and the JNLP standard, so that your customers can continue using applications based on Java Web Start and JNLP without any change. OpenWebStart is based on Iced-Tea-Web and follows the JNLP-specification defined in JSR-56.

The main focus of OpenWebStart is the execution of JNLP-based applications. Additionally, the tool contains various modules that simplify your Web Start workflows and let you configure OpenWebStart to suit your needs:

App Manager:: manages the versions of any JNLP-based application that is executed by OpenWebStart.

JVM Manager:: manages Java versions and Java updates on the client.

Control Panel:: provides a graphical user interface to configure OpenWebStart.

Updater:: downloads and installs new versions of OpenWebStart.

== Installation
OpenWebStart can be installed on Windows, MacOS and Linux operating systems and there are two different ways to install OpenWebStart:

* Using the *interactive installation* with auto-update functionality
* Using the *unattended installation* for automated roll-outs

If you use Web Start for several small customers or on your own, we recommend using the interactive installer. Our native installer will set up everything on your Windows, Mac, or Linux system so that OpenWebStart is immediately ready to use.
OpenWebStart checks for updates automatically, and the Updater component keeps the tool current without the need for any user interaction.

If you or your customers are companies with IT departments of their own, we recommend an unattended installation to roll out OpenWebStart on multiple client machines.
Instead of walking through the graphical installer of OWS on every machine your IT department can pre-define the responses for the installation options in a response varfile.

If you need help installing OpenWebStart, also have a look at the public installation and configuration discussions at the https://board.karakun.com/viewforum.php?f=10[Support Forum].

=== Installation Artifacts
The artifacts of an installed release are the follows:

OpenWebStart main executable:: Application to launch a JNLP file. +
* _javaws.exe_ (Windows), +
* _OpenWebStart javaws.app_ (macOS)

OpenWebStart settings executable:: Application to configure your OpenWebStart installation. +
* _itw-settings.exe_ (Windows), +
* _OpenWebStart Settings.app_ (macOS)

Uninstaller executable:: Application to uninstall OpenWebStart from your system. +
* _uninstall.exe_ (Windows)
* _OpenWebStart Uninstaller.app_ (macOS)

jre directory (Windows):: The bundled JRE that starts OpenWebStart

javaws.vmoptions:: JVM arguments used by the bundled JRE when starting OpenWebStart main executable (javaws)

itw-settings.vmoptions:: JVM arguments used by the bundled JRE when starting OpenWebStart settings executable (itw-settings)

 .install4J directory:: Contains install4j installer files including *_response.varfile_* used for the unattended installation.

openwebstart.jar:: OpenWebStart application jar

{asterisk}.png:: Some icons used by OpenWebStart

readme.txt:: Describes OpenWebStart release contents and useful links

=== Unattended Installation
If you or your customers are companies with IT departments of their own, we recommend an unattended installation to roll
out OpenWebStart on multiple client machines.
In this scenario, the auto-update functionality is inactive; your IT department is free to plan and handle rollouts of new versions based on your internal workflows.

When installing OpenWebStart, several properties can be predefined in a so-called `response.varfile` file.

Some of the supported properties are lockable. If a property is lockable, you can define an additional property of type `PROPERTY_NAME.locked=true` to prevent users from editing the property in the user interface.
For example, to define a value for the `ows.jvm.manager.server.default` property that cannot be changed in the user interface, specify the following two properties:

----
ows.jvm.manager.server.default=https://my.custom.server
ows.jvm.manager.server.default.locked=true
----

Have a look at the <<Configuration Properties Overview>> to get an overview of all properties that can be specified in
the `response.varfile`.

To create a `response.varfile` file, run the installation of OpenWebStart at least once manually. By doing so a
`response.varfile` file is created in OpenWebStart installation folder in your system. In the installation folder,
you find a `.install4j` folder that contains the basic `response.varfile` file. The content of such a file looks like this:

----
sys.adminRights$Boolean=false
sys.fileAssociation.extensions$StringArray="jnlp","jnlpx"
sys.fileAssociation.launchers$StringArray="313","313"
sys.installationDir=/Applications/OpenWebStart
sys.languageId=de
----

You can easily edit this file and add additional properties based on the table in this article. Do not change the initial content of the file, and add new properties always to the end of the file. After editing, a `response.varfile` file might look like this:

----
sys.adminRights$Boolean=false
sys.fileAssociation.extensions$StringArray="jnlp","jnlpx"
sys.fileAssociation.launchers$StringArray="313","313"
sys.installationDir=/Applications/OpenWebStart
sys.languageId=de
ows.jvm.manager.server.default=https://my.custom.server
ows.jvm.manager.server.default.locked=true
----

You can now use your enhanced file to install OpenWebStart on multiple machines. Simply copy the enhanced `response.varfile`
next to the installer and execute the following command:

----
<OpenWebStart_windows_Setup.exe> -q -varfile response.varfile
----

=== JNLP File Association

To ensure that your computer handles links, desktop shortcuts, or start menu entries to JNLP applications correctly, you should associate the JNLP file type (`*.jnlp`) on your computer with OpenWebStart.
In case you used a Oracle JVM in the past, your JNLP file association might still be set to Oracle javaws.

Note that during the installation process, OpenWebStart will not change file associations of any existing Oracle javaws executable, so you can use both.

To associate .JNLP applications in Windows Explorer

1. Right-click the JNLP app and select *Open With > Choose Another App*
1. Click *More Apps* and scroll down
1. Click *Look for Another App on this PC*
1. Browse to OpenWebStart at +
   `C:\Program Files\OpenWebStart\javaws`
1. Click *Open* to associate this JNLP file with OpenWebStart

To associate .JNLP applications in macOS Finder:

1. Right-click the JNLP app and select *Open With > Other...*
1. Browse to OpenWebStart at `/Applications/Open Web Start/javaws`
1. Click *Open* to associate this JNLP file with OpenWebStart

=== How to Uninstall

In case you need to uninstall OpenWebStart follow the steps below:

For Windows and macOS::

1. Go to your OpenWebStart directory
1. Run the Uninstaller
1. Click *Next* in the OpenWebstart Uninstaller Wizard
1. Wait for the Uninstaller to complete
1. Click *Finish* on the completion screen to close the wizard.

For Linux:: Use your package manager and remove the package OpenWebStart

=== Running OWS from portable USB stick

It is possible to run OWS from a portable USB stick without actually installing OWS on your machine.
Although this is a quick way of running OWS, the downside of not using the installer is that you do not
get the support of the underlying operating system in terms of file associations, registry entries and
desktop integration. So if you can (and want to) do without the file associations, desktop icon and startup menu
you can create a portable version by yourself.

All files required for execution are located in the installation directory (see <<Installation Artifacts>>.
It is therefore sufficient to copy this directory onto a USB stick and then to run the main executable (Windows: _javaws.exe_) and settings executable (Windows: _itw-settins.exe_) by mounting
the USB stick on the target computer.

If you want the settings and the cache to remain on the USB stick, the path to these two directories can
be set with the following environment variables:

```
XDG_CACHE_HOME (default value is %USER_HOME%\.cache)

XDG_CONFIG_HOME (default: %USER_HOME%\.config)
```

To run OWS from a USB stick it is recommended to create a small batch script that sets the two variables
and then executes the executables:

```
javaws.exe [url-to-jnlp | path-to-jnlp] [options]
```

It should also be mentioned that with a new release of OWS the two things that usually change are:
```
\openwebstart.jar (the application must be updated)

\jre\ (the bundled JRE which is used to run OpenWebStart)
```

So you might want to update these files in the USB stick to keep your OWS installation up-to-date.

=== Local vs. System-Wide Installation

You can install OWS for the current user or for all users of the computer.

Once OWS is installed on your machine it can be configured locally using the local `deployment.config` file or it can take its configuration from a centralized enterprise wide `deployment.config`.
This is described in detail at <<Configuration>>.

// TODO: mention that installing it both on the same machine might cause conflicts

== Updates

OpenWebStart can be configured to automatically check for new releases and perform automatic updates.

To do so go to the "Updates" Panel in the OWS Settings.

image::OWS_Updates.png[title="OWS Update options" width="80%"]

It is possible to define an update strategy on every `start`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, or `never`.

== Configuration

The standard way to configure OpenWebStart is to use the OWS Settings application.
The executable is located in the installation directory and is named `itw-settings`.

image::OWS_Configuration.png[title="Configuring OWS Settings" width="80%"]

All settings managed by this application are stored on the file system in a file called `deployment.properties`.
For Windows the file is located at `${USER_HOME}\.config\icedtea-web\deployment.properties`.
For Mac and Linux the file is located at `${USER_HOME}/.config/icedtea-web/deployment.properties`.

This file can be edited with a regular text editor.
For some expert configurations this may be necessary, but for most cases the graphical UI will be sufficient.

Various life-cycle aspects of your JNLP applications can be configured, such as download and update strategy or caching
behavior. You can configure the JVM vendor and version that should be used to launch your JNLP application as well as
proxy settings, security settings, certificates and server whitelists.

NOTE: Please refer to <<Configuration Properties Overview>> for details of deployment properties.

When loading the configuration during the start of OpenWebStart the following steps are executed:

1. Load the default values which are hardcoded in the source code.
2. Search for a system configuration.
3. Load the system configuration if one can be found.
4. Load the user configuration.

Whenever a configuration is loaded the values which are already defined are updated.
There is however the possibility to lock a property.
If a property is locked then subsequent configurations may not modify the value.
This allows enforcing certain values on a system level.
Any changes the user makes in his personal configuration file will not have any effect on the locked property.

=== Content of the System Configuration

The simplest way to create a system configuration is to start the `itw-settings`.
After saving the configuration the modified properties are written to the user configuration file.
For Windows the file is located at `${USER_HOME}\.config\icedtea-web\deployment.properties`.
For Mac and Linux the file is located at `${USER_HOME}/.config/icedtea-web/deployment.properties`.

The customized user configuration can be used as a starting point for the system configuration.
Simply copy the file and remove the properties which should not be defined on the system level.

OpenWebStart does not save properties which have the default value. Therefore, the generated user configuration may not
contain all the values you wish to enforce on the system level.

=== Locking a Property

One of the use cases is to enforce some configurations to all users in your corporate environment.
This can be achieved by locking configuration on a system level.
To lock a property you need to define a second entry with a `.locked` postfix.

Here is an example:

[source]
----
ows.jvm.manager.server.default=https\://192.168.1.1/jvms.json
ows.jvm.manager.server.default.locked=true
----

TIP: the value of `ows.jvm.manager.server.default.locked` is ignored.
The presence of the key is sufficient for locking the property.

The following sections will describe these various configuration possibilities in detail.

=== User Level Configuration
OWS can be configured locally by specifying properties in `<User Home>\.config\icedtea-web\deployment.properties` file.

=== Enterprise or System-wide Configuration
In an enterprise environment, for uniformity of behavior, it is preferred that all users use the same configuration for OWS.

It is possible to configure OWS with a system-wide configuration. This allows setting up a common configuration for
multiple users at a centralized location on a single computer. This helps in managing a corporate infrastructure where
many computers need to be configured identically.

Centralized location for `configuration` and `cache` can be specified using `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and
`XDG_CACHE_HOME` environment variables.

The centralized `configuration` comprises:

* deployment.properties : all users must use the same deployment.properties for OWS
* user decisions  (.appletTrustSettings)
* logs - logs for the app started by each user
* security (certificate stores)
* icons - for the app started by user

The centralized `cache` comprises

* jvm_cache : directory where common set of downloaded JVMs are stored
* cache and recently_used file : directory for caching the jnlp and resources of the applications started by users
* temp dir : Directory created by OWS for temp files.

=== Configuring Location of `jvm_cache`
`jvm_cache` location can be configured using the property `ows.jvm.manager.cache.dir`  in the centralized
`deployment.properties` file :

```
ows.jvm.manager.cache.dir=c:\\temp\\JVMCacheDir
```

NOTE: `ows.jvm.manager.cache.dir` specification in `deployment.properties` takes precedence over `XDG_CACHE_HOME`.

=== Configuring Location of `deployment.properties`

It is possible to make OWS use `deployment.properties` from a customized location.

A user-level `deployment.properties` file always exists in the `<User Home>/.config/icedtea-web` directory.
There can also be an optional system-level `deployment.properties` file. If it exists, its location is determined by
a System Administrator through the `deployment.config` file. The `deployment.config` file is used for specifying the
system-level `deployment.properties` in the infrastructure. By default no `deployment.config` file exists, so no
system-wide `deployment.properties` file exists. If the `deployment.config` file exists, it is located in one of the
directories shown in the following table:

|===
|Operating System|Location
|Windows|`<Windows Directory>\Sun\Java\Deployment\deployment.config`

| MacOS and Linux|`/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.config`

|===

deployment.system.config:: The URL to the system configuration.
The name of the file can be freely chosen.
Special characters need escaping.
See the following examples:
* `deployment.system.config=file\:/C\:/Windows/Sun/Java/global.properties`
* `deployment.system.config=file\:/etc/.java/deployment/base.properties`
* `deployment.system.config=https\:192.168.1.1./javaws/system.properties`

deployment.system.config.mandatory:: If set to `true` then OpenWebStart will fail if it is unable to load the system settings
This property is optional. The default value is `false`.

The final file should look something like this:

[source]
----
deployment.system.config=https\:192.168.1.1./javaws/system.properties
deployment.system.config.mandatory=true
----

OWS will then pick up deployment.properties from the specified file when deployment.properties is *not* present in <User Home>\.config\icedtea-web directory

When deployment.properties *is* present in <User Home>\.config\icedtea-web directory then has precedence for specified properties.

=== JVM Manager

OWS provides facility to choose set of JVMs that can be used to run the applications specified in JNLP files

image::OWS_JVM_Mgmt.png[title="JVM Management" width="80%"]

One can choose or automatically add locally available JVMs or one can specify the server from where JVMs can be downloaded.

image::OWS_JVM_Config.PNG[title="Configuring JVM Management" width="80%"]

==== JVM Download Server

OpenWebStart can fetch JVMs and JVM updates from a download server that is specified in the JVM Manager Configuration of the OWS Settings application.
The default points to `https://download-openwebstart.com/jvms.json`.

==== Setup a Custom Download Server
If you want to set up your own JVM download server you must provide a json file which lists all available JVMs.

This json file must contain the following data:

[source]
----
{
    "cacheTimeInMillis":<miliseconds>,
    "runtimes":[
        {
            "version":<JVM version>,
            "vendor":<vendor name>,
            "os":<OS identifier>,
            "href":<absolute url to the archive containing the JVM>
        },

        ... more runtime definitions
}

----

cacheTimeInMillis:: The time which needs to elapse before a client is allowed to contact the server again. Usually the server is accessed once per application startup.

os:: Possible values are: MAC64, MAC32, LINUX64, LINUX32, WIN64, WIN32

==== Allowing JVM Server in JNLP and defining a JVM Server Whitelist

You can allow specification of JVM server in the JNLP file by defining the property:
_ows.jvm.manager.server.allowFromJnlp=true_.
In this case the JVM will be downloaded from the URL specified in the JNLP file:
[source]
----
<java version="1.8*" href="http://myjvms.myserver.com/jvms.json"/>
----

When allowing JVM server download from the JNLP file, as a security measure it
is advisable to define a whitelist for JVM server URLs that will be specified in JNLP files.
JVMs will be allowed to be downloaded from only those server URLs that match a whitelist entry.

The JVM server whitelist can be defined in the _deployment properties_ file _${userHome}/.config/icedtea-web/deployment.properties_:

[source]
----
ows.jvm.manager.server.allowFromJnlp.whitelist=myjvms.myserver.com, *.jvms.com
----

It is possible to specify wildcards in the URLs specified in the whitelist. Please see the section on "Server Whitelist" for details.

==== Whitelist for JVM Arguments

OWS starts the JNLP application with the JVM that best matches JVM in the JNLP file.
While starting the JVM, OWS passes the JVM arguments specified in the JNLP file:

```
<java version="1.8+"  java-vm-args=" -Xmx512m -Xms128m -XX:SurvivorRatio=6 -XX:NewSize=96m -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=20 -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=30"/>
```

OWS maintains a hardcoded list of secure JVM arguments as specified at:

* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/javaws/developersguide/syntax.html#secure-property
* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/tools/java.htm#JSWOR624
* https://news.kynosarges.org/2019/03/24/swing-high-dpi-properties/

OWS allows only those JVM args that are in the above lists. However, sometimes with new versions of JREs new JVM arguments
are introduced. Also, some of the valid arguments are not documented in the above lists. In such cases it is possible for
the user to specify new JVM arguments in the `deployment.properties` for OWS to alow them to be passed to the JVM:

```
deployment.jvm.arguments.whitelist=-Dnew_jvm_arg1, -Dnew_jvm_arg2
```

Subsequently the JNLP file can include the above JVM args:

```
<java version="x"  java-vm-args="-Dnew_jvm_arg1=value1 -Dnew_jvm_arg2=value2"/>
```

=== Cache Management

OWS downloads the resources like jars and images specified in the JNLP file from the specified server(s).
OWS stores application resources for faster execution by avoiding downloading the next time you run the application.
By default, application resources are stored in _<User Home>/.cache/icedtea-web/.cache directory_. However, OWS will
download resources for the application if it finds that a resource has been updated on the server.

To find out whether a resource has been modified since the last download, OWS sends a _HTTP HEAD_ request to the server and
expects to receive the last modified timestamp of the resource on the server.  In order to facilitate caching of resources
by OWS it is necessary that the server from where the resources are downloaded is configured to respond to _HTTP HEAD_
request. In case the server is not configured to respond to _HTTP HEAD_ request, OWS will not be able to determine the
last modified timestamp of the resource and will go ahead and download the resource.

The OWS cache can be configured and managed:

image::OWS_Cache_Mgmt.PNG[title="Configuring Cache Management" width="80%"]


=== Application Management

An experimental feature has been provided to manage applications downloaded by OWS.
This feature can be enabled by setting the following property in `deployment.properties`:

```
ows.experimental.applicationManager.active=true
```

image::OWS_APP_Mgmt.png[title="Application Management" width="80%"]

The Application manager shows the list of downloaded applications. It allows to

* start the appliaction
* create a shortcut
* delete the application from cache.

=== Proxy Settings

It is possible to configure proxy to be used by OWS when it downloads jnlp files and resources:

image::OWS_PROXY_Mgmt.png[title="Proxy Settings" width="80%"]

=== Security Settings

Security settings for OWS can be configured in the Security panel:

image::OWS_Security.png[title="Security Settings" width="80%"]

==== Suppressing security checks on manifest

If security related attributes (such as `permissions` etc) are missing in the manifest of a signed jar, OWS displays a Security dialog:

image::OWS_MissingPermission.PNG[title="Secuirty Dialog" width="80%"]

You can choose to "Remember this option" for the site and Press the Yes button. Your decision will be stored in the file <User_HOME>/.config/icedtea-web\.appletTrustSettings. Next time when you start the jnlp you will not be shown the above dialog.

Alternatively, you can suppress the checking of selected or all manifest attributes by specifying the following property in your `deployment.properties` file:

```
deployment.manifest.attributes.check=NONE
```

Default value of this property is `ALL`.

Other values for this property are `PERMISSIONS`, `CODEBASE`, `TRUSTED`, `ALAC`, `ENTRYPOINT`.
You can specify a comma separated list these Manifest attributes to be checked by OWS.
For example if you want all except `Permissions` attribute to be checked by OWS ManifestChecker then
you could specify:

```
deployment.manifest.attributes.check= CODEBASE,TRUSTED,ALAC,ENTRYPOINT
```

=== Certificates

image::OWS_Certificates.PNG[title="Managing Certificates" width="80%"]
// TODO Stephan
// mention limitation on system tab

#<documentation added in the near future>#
// TODO

=== Server Whitelist

The "Server Whitelist" panel in OWS settings displays the server whitelist.
To define a server whitelist you have to edit the `deployment.properties` file in your config directory with a text editor by adding a new line similar to the following:

[source]
----
deployment.security.whitelist=10.10.10.10, google.com, some.server.net
----

The different servers are listed as a comma separated string.
Localhost is implicitly always in the white list.
If you delete the line again then no whitelisting is applied and all servers are reachable.

Note that whitelisting only applies while downloading resources (jars and jnlps) and not while an application is running.
Thus an application can open a connection to a server which is not in the white list.

It is also possible to specify the content of the whitelist in the response file of an unattended OWS installation.

It is possible to specify a wildcard in the host and port part of the URL. The following table illustrates the rules for whitelist URLs with wildcard:
|===
|Whitelist entry|UI Displayed|Comment

|http://subdomain.domain.com:8080|http://subdomain.domain.com:8080|only the specified protocol, host port combination is whitelisted
|domain.com|https://domain.com:443|since HTTPS and 443 are defaults
|100.101.102.103|https://100.101.102.103:443|since HTTPS and 443 are defaults
|http://subdomain.domain.com|http://subdomain.domain.com:80|since HTTP is used default port is 80
|https://subdomain.domain.com|https://subdomain.domain.com:443|since HTTPS is used default port is 443
|https://subdomain.domain.com:*|https://subdomain.domain.com:*|any port is whitelisted
|https://*.domain.com:443|https://*.domain.com:443|any domain which ends in "domain.com" is whitelisted
|\*.domain.com:*|https://\*.domain.com:*|any domain which ends in ".domain.com" and any port is whitelisted
|https://*:443|https://*:443 |any host but with protocol https and port 443 is whitelisted (any part other than the first part of host cannot be a wildcard)
|https://jvms.*:443|Error: invalid host|* is only allowed at position 0 of the host name
|https://*jvms.domain.com:443|Error: invalid host|for host part use either * or text but not combination
|https://jvms.*.domain.com:443|Error: invalid host|* is only allowed at position 0 of the host name
|https://subdomain.domain.com:1*|Error: Invalid port|only a number in the range 1-65535 or * is valid for the port
|https://*.123.134.145|Error: Invalid IP Address|IP address cannot have a  wildcard
|https://100.1*.134.145|Error: Invalid IP Address|IP address cannot have a  wildcard
|===


=== Logging

OpenWebStart provides access to log message information to monitor application execution and analyse erroneous behavior by the Log Console GUI and log files. Both can be enabled in the "Logging" panel in OWS settings.

.Logging options in OWS Settings
image::OWS_Logging.png[width="80%", align="center"]

==== Log Console
OpenWebStart provides the possiblity to show a log console window where all log messages of OpenWebStart iteself and the launched JNLP application are displayed.

Various filter options can be selected to reduce the log output. To show the log console choose "Show" in "Log Console" selection.

==== Logging to Files
Logging to files can be activated for file-based log analysis or to send the logs files to the OpenWebStart support.

You have to select "Activate debug logging", "Log to file", and specify the log folder where OpenWebStart should write the log files.

By default this is `<user_home>/.config/icedtea-web/log`. Ensure that your folder has write access permissions when customize this path.

When launching a JNLP application, OpenWebStart produces three log files for different stages. They all following the naming convention:
----
   <timestamp>-ows-stage<stage number>.log
----
There first file (according to creation timestamp) contains log events produced by the OpenWebStart launcher. It basically contains information on the laucher arguments and the location of the deployment.properties. It is created in stage 1.

The second file (still stage 1) contains log events on the start-up of OpenWebStart itself. It provides details on version and update status, embedded JVM version, JVM arguments, keystores loaded, validation and parsing results of the JNLP file, and details on the VM required by and used to finally launch the JNLP application. It ends with all the details about the command that OpenWebStart is about to execute to launch the JNLP application.

The third log file (stage 2) logs the events that happen when OpenWebStart launches the JNLP application. *This is probably the most relevant log file for OpenWebStart users.* It provides details on how the launch and execution of the JNLP application is going, such as the resources downloaded for the application. *If your application cannot start properly, this log file is the best place to look for any error messages or stack traces.*

Note that log files of the OpenWebStart Settings application also goes to this log directory. They are named

----
<timestamp>-ows-settings.log
----

You will rarely need those.

=== Remote Debugging
